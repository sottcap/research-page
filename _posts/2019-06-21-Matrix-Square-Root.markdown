It seems that calculating square-root matrix of diffusion tensor $$ \tilde{D} $$ is critical step for the BD with HI.
But, if the displacement is small so that we can treat the changes in the square-matrix as perturbations,
is it possible to generate square-root matrix much faster than others? 

See an [arxiv article] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01464.pdf).
