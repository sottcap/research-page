## Summary

I am a well-trained researcher having skill set fit to biophysics or physical chemistry based modeling and simulation in wide range of fields from academia to industry. 

I am motivated by other people's needs as well as my own interests but my research interest is not limited to esoteric scientific problems but is often expanded to practical application. 

I hope to find the best way of balancing between gratifying my pure scientific curiosity and my desire to contribute to an innovation of a real world.
